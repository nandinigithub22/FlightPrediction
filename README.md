#Introduction
The Flight Price Prediction system is designed to predict the cost of flights based on multiple factors such as airline, departure time, arrival time, and more. The system is implemented using a machine learning model trained on historical flight data.

#Features
Predicts flight prices based on various input features.
Supports different data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values.
Provides insights through visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, etc.

#Installation
To get started with the Flight Price Prediction system, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
-git clone https://github.com/nandinigithub/FlightPrediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
-cd FlightPrediction
Install the required dependencies:
-pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
To use the flight price prediction system:

Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook flight_price.ipynb
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook:
1. Import the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
3. Train the model and make predictions.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.


#Data
